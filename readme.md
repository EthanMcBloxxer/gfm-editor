# gfm-editor
A GitHub Flavored Markdown Editor â€“ Using GitHub

## Why?
It's not that easy to find a fully working GFM Webeditor that supports HTML as well as Markdown.

## How?
There's two options for you here:
1. Go to https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/gfm-editor/edit/main/draft.md (this will create a fork)
2. Go to https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/gfm-editor/issues/new (this won't create a fork)

## More
I took this idea from https://github.com/ZekeLu/GFM-editor but I found that issues weren't mentioned as a method of editing the markdown.
### Limitations
* You must be connected to the internet
* Using method 1 will create a fork
* Commiting is probably a bad idea
* Don't preview changes if you have confidential information, it does send the data to GitHub temporarily.

## Storing Files
If you'd like to store files, I **highly** recommend changing the repository's name to your username, like EthanMcBloxxer / EthanMcBloxxer. Then, the readme.md will show up on your profile page, and you can store drafts in a `/drafts/` folder.
